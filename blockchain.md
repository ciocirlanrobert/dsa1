For this problem I used a Linked List to store the blocks for the blockchain.

Time Complexities:
    => Adding a new block O(1) ( I add it to the head )
    => Get the block by inded O(n)

Space Complexities:
Let n = number of blocks added in a blockchain
    => Hash Map : O(n)
    => LinkedList : O(n)
